1,Work on assignment operators?

a=10
b=0
c=60
a+=c
c-=b
a*=a
c/=c
c//=a
a%=2
b+=10
b<<=2
b>>=4
print(a,b,c)

o/p:-0 2 0.0

2,Work on comparsion operators?

a=10
b=10
c=40
if(a==b):
    print("wow")
    if(b>c):
        print("awesome")
        if(a<c):
            print("sample")
elif(a>=b):
    print("both a and b may or may not equal")
else:
    print("somrthing")

o/p:-wow

3,Work on bitwise operators?

a=2
b=4
print(a&b)
print(a|b)
print(a^b)
print(~a)

o/p:-
0
6
6
-3

4,Work on tuple and dictionary?

Tuple:-A tuple is though similar to a list but it is immutable. Another difference between a list and a tuple is tuples are heterogeneous 
data structures whereas list is a homogeneous data atructures.

Dictionary:-Dictionary is an associative array of key-value pairs.It is unordered and requires the keys to be hashable search operations 
happen to be faster in adictionary as they use keys for lookups.                    

5,Explanation on methods?

seed():-It is used to generate random numbers.
getstate():-It is used to capture the state and return the value generate with the current state.
randint():-To give random outputs
shuffle():-It is used to shuffle the elements in the list or any other data structure.
choice():-It is used to return the random sequence element from the list or tuple.
traingular:-It is used to return random floating number from two specified numbers.
random():-It is used to give random results.

6,Write a python program for prime logic wthout using loops?
 
def prime(n,d):
   if(n//2<d):
       return true
   if(n%d==0):
       return false
   return prime(n,d+1)

def find_primes(n,i,result):
    if(i==n+1):
       return result
    if(prime(i,2)):
       result.append(i)
    return find_primes(n,i+1,result)

print(find_primes(100,2,[]))

o/p:-[2,3,5,7,9,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,57,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97]
